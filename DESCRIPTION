Description: A collection of tools for performing the second step of 
    Hermeneutic Content Analysis (HCA; see Bergman, 2010, 
    <doi:10.4135/9781506335193>). The current version 
    provides tools for implementing multidimensional scaling (MDS) within 
    an HCA framework. The tools offer assistance in data preparation, modeling, 
    and interpretation of MDS maps. The data preparation tools help 
    users to create similarity matrices based on co-occurrence or sorting 
    data. The modelling tools allow users to optimize the modelling process 
    by systematically calculating Stress values for a set of p points out of n 
    points. The tools assisting interpretation allow users to highlight the 
    highest similarities either per point or overall in an MDS representation.
